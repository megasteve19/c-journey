# My Personal Journey with C

Hello, this is the repository where I will learn and practice C programming language. In the past, while learning web technologies, I had a "folder" like this and it was just bunch of random things that I was trying to learn and practice. It was a great experience and I learned a lot.

For a while, I have been thinking about learning a low-level programming language. My options were C, C++, and Rust. I decided to go with C because it seemed like the most basic one compared to the other two, yet powerful enough to learn the basics of low-level programming.

Like what I did with web, I'm going to have bunch of little apps and projects in this repository. Feel free to look around!
